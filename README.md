# pd-lacrimosa
Project made using the visual programming language Pure Data, it involves an applied study of sound frequencies and polyphony in music.
The program generates, in a loop, the combination of frequencies from the first measure of Mozart's Lacrimosa. 
It allows you to control (ON/OFF) each melodic line of the present voice division.
